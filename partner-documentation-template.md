# How to order Vipps

All merchants order Vipps on
[portal.vipps.no](https://portal.vipps.no):

1. Log in with BankID
   (everyone with BankID can log in)
2. Search for your company's name or organization number.
3. Fill in the required information.
   Most fields have a small `i`: Click that for help.
   If you need help: Contact us (your parter) first,
   and we will contact Vipps if needed.
4. Sign the application with BankID on the company's behalf.
5. Order "Vipps på nett":
   * Specify that the customer is present when making the purchase
   * Specify us as your partner ("leverandør") in the dropdown menu
   * Select the correct price package in the dropdown menu
   * Specify the name of the new "sale unit" (your store)
   * Select the correct category for the new sale unit.
   * Describe how Vipps will be used for the new sale unit, maybe:
     "Vipps integrert i POS med komplett løsning levert av partner"

You may get follow-up questions from Vipps. Please check your email,
including the "spam" folder.

You can check the status of your Vipps order on

**Please note:** Vipps is working on improvements, including:

* Later: A Partner API that let partners (mass) sign up new merchants.
